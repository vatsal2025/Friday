- Request signing validation
- Rate limiting per API key

### 2.8 Data Pipeline Integration
**Gap:** Limited data pipeline connections  
**Current State:** Basic DataPipeline references  
**Required:**
- Full data pipeline integration
- Stream processing support
- Batch processing capabilities
- Data quality validation
- Error recovery mechanisms

## 3. CONFIGURATION GAPS üîß

### 3.1 Missing External System Configurations
The unified_config.py has placeholders but needs actual configurations for:
- Production broker APIs (beyond Zerodha)
- Market data providers (Bloomberg, Reuters, etc.)
- News feed integrations
- Social media APIs
- Economic data sources

### 3.2 Environment-Specific Configurations
- Development vs Production settings
