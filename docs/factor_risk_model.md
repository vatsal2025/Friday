# Factor-Based Risk Model

## Overview

The Factor-Based Risk Model is a comprehensive implementation for analyzing portfolio risk through the lens of factor exposures. This model allows for a more nuanced understanding of portfolio risk by decomposing it into systematic factor risks and specific (idiosyncratic) risks.

The implementation supports three types of factor models:

1. **Fundamental Factor Models**: Based on observable characteristics of securities such as value, size, momentum, quality, and industry/sector exposures.

2. **Statistical Factor Models**: Derived from statistical analysis of historical returns, identifying latent factors that explain return covariance.

3. **Macroeconomic Factor Models**: Based on sensitivities to macroeconomic variables such as GDP growth, inflation, interest rates, and other economic indicators.

## Key Components

### FactorRiskModel

The core class that implements the factor-based risk model methodology. It provides methods for:

- Calculating factor exposures for a portfolio
- Estimating factor returns over a specified time period
- Computing factor covariance matrices
- Calculating factor risk metrics (factor risk, specific risk, total risk)
- Running factor-based stress tests

### FactorRiskModelAdapter

An adapter class that implements the `ExternalRiskModel` interface, allowing the factor-based risk model to be integrated with the existing risk management framework. This adapter enables:

- Seamless integration with the `RiskModelIntegrator`
- Consistent API for risk metrics across different risk model types
- Standardized stress testing capabilities

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from src.risk.factor_risk_model import FactorRiskModel

# Create a factor risk model instance
model = FactorRiskModel(model_type="fundamental")

# Calculate factor exposures for a portfolio
exposures = model.get_factor_exposures(portfolio)

# Calculate factor risk metrics
risk_metrics = model.calculate_factor_risk(portfolio)

# Run a stress test
stress_test_results = model.run_factor_stress_test(portfolio, scenario_shocks)
```

### Integration with Risk Model Integrator

```python
from src.risk.factor_risk_model import FactorRiskModelAdapter
from src.risk.risk_model_integrator import RiskModelIntegrator

# Create factor risk model adapters
fundamental_adapter = FactorRiskModelAdapter(model_type="fundamental")
macroeconomic_adapter = FactorRiskModelAdapter(model_type="macroeconomic")

# Create a risk model integrator
integrator = RiskModelIntegrator()

# Register the factor risk model adapters
integrator.register_model("fundamental", fundamental_adapter)
integrator.register_model("macro", macroeconomic_adapter)

# Activate the models
integrator.activate_model("fundamental")
integrator.activate_model("macro")

# Get combined risk metrics
combined_metrics = integrator.get_combined_risk_metrics(portfolio)

# Get combined factor exposures
combined_exposures = integrator.get_combined_factor_exposures(portfolio)
```

## Factor Categories

### Fundamental Factors

- **Style Factors**: Value, Size, Momentum, Quality, Growth, Volatility, Yield, Liquidity
- **Industry Factors**: Technology, Financials, Healthcare, Consumer Discretionary, etc.
- **Country/Region Factors**: US, Europe, Japan, Emerging Markets, etc.

### Statistical Factors

- **Principal Components**: PC1, PC2, PC3, etc.
- **Cluster Factors**: Cluster1, Cluster2, Cluster3, etc.

### Macroeconomic Factors

- **Market Factors**: Equity Beta, Credit Beta, etc.
- **Rate Factors**: Interest Rate, Yield Curve, etc.
- **Economic Indicators**: GDP Growth, Inflation, Unemployment, etc.
- **Commodity Factors**: Energy, Metals, Agriculture, etc.
- **Currency Factors**: USD, EUR, JPY, etc.

## Stress Testing

The factor-based risk model supports comprehensive stress testing capabilities:

- **Predefined Scenarios**: Financial Crisis, COVID Crash, Rate Hike, Inflation Shock
- **Custom Scenarios**: Define custom factor shocks to analyze portfolio sensitivity
- **Scenario Analysis**: Analyze portfolio performance under different stress scenarios

## Implementation Details

### Factor Exposure Calculation

Factor exposures are calculated based on the portfolio holdings and their characteristics:

- For fundamental models, exposures are derived from security attributes
- For statistical models, exposures are estimated from historical returns
- For macroeconomic models, exposures are based on sensitivities to economic variables

### Factor Risk Calculation

Factor risk is calculated using the following methodology:

1. Calculate factor exposures for the portfolio
2. Estimate the factor covariance matrix
3. Compute factor risk as: sqrt(X' * F * X), where:
   - X is the vector of factor exposures
   - F is the factor covariance matrix

### Specific Risk Calculation

Specific risk represents the idiosyncratic risk not explained by factor exposures:

1. Calculate total portfolio risk based on security-level covariances
2. Calculate factor risk as described above
3. Compute specific risk as: sqrt(total_risk² - factor_risk²)
