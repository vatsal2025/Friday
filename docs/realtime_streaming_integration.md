# Real-time Streaming Integration Plan

## Overview

This document outlines a detailed implementation plan for enhancing the Portfolio Integration System with real-time streaming capabilities. The current implementation relies on event-based updates and periodic polling for market data updates, which may introduce latency and inefficiencies. Implementing real-time streaming integration will significantly improve the responsiveness and accuracy of the portfolio management system.

## Current State Analysis

The current portfolio integration has the following limitations regarding real-time updates:

1. **Polling-Based Updates**: Market data updates rely on periodic polling or manual event triggering.

2. **Event-Driven Architecture**: The system uses an event-driven architecture but lacks true streaming capabilities.

3. **Potential Latency**: There may be latency between market data changes and portfolio updates.

4. **Limited Throughput**: The current architecture may not efficiently handle high-frequency updates.

5. **No Backpressure Handling**: The system lacks mechanisms to handle backpressure during high update volumes.
